/*
Plug in credentials to dynago from aws-sdk-go

This allows dynago to use credential management that comes from AWS-SDK-Go
such as environment, file, and most importantly EC2 role credentials providers.

This uses internal packages in dynago that are in the middle of refactoring,
so consider this in flux.

Usage:
	import "github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/aws"
	import "github.com/crast/dynatools/credentials"

	executor := dynago.NewAwsExecutor(...)
	credentials.New("us-east-1", aws.DefaultChainCredentials).Install(executor)
	client := dynago.NewClient(executor)

	"github.com/almonteb/dynago"
